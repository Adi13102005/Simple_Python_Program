        "*   **Factorial Function**: The `compute_factorial` function was successfully implemented, calculating the factorial for non-negative integers (e.g., $0! = 1$, $1! = 1$, $5! = 120$) and robustly handling invalid inputs (negative numbers and non-integers) by raising a `ValueError`.\n",
        "*   **Multiplication Table Function**: The `display_multiplication_table` function correctly generated and printed the multiplication table for a positive integer (e.g., for $5$, from $5 \\times 1 = 5$ to $5 \\times 10 = 50$) and included validation to ensure the input was a positive integer, raising a `ValueError` for invalid inputs.\n",
        "*   **Odd/Even Identification Function**: The `is_odd_or_even` function accurately identified integers as \"Even\" (e.g., $0, 2, -4$) or \"Odd\" (e.g., $5, -7$) and included input validation to ensure only integer inputs were accepted, raising a `ValueError` for non-integers.\n",
        "*   **Palindrome Number Function**: The `is_palindrome_number` function correctly identified palindrome numbers (e.g., $121, 12321, 0, 1$) and non-palindrome numbers (e.g., $123, -121, 10$). It also featured input validation to accept only integers, raising a `ValueError` for other types.\n",
        "*   **Simple Expert System**: A `simple_expert_system` was developed using a rule-based approach. Initially, strict keyword matching led to limited query resolution. However, by refining the knowledge base with more generic keywords (e.g., \"internet\" instead of \"problem with internet\"), the system significantly improved its ability to match user queries (e.g., \"I have a problem with my internet connection.\" successfully matched \"internet\"). Queries not matching any rule consistently received a default \"no specific advice\" response.\n",

        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   All implemented functions demonstrated robust input validation, which is crucial for the reliability and usability of software applications, preventing unexpected errors due to incorrect data types or values.\n",
        "*   The simple expert system effectively illustrates a rule-based decision-making process. For future enhancements, incorporating natural language processing (NLP) techniques could improve keyword extraction and intent recognition, making the system more flexible and user-friendly by understanding a wider range of user phrasing.\n"
